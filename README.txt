skdata (scikit-data)
====================

Skdata is a library of datasets for empirical computer science. Lots of
disciplines such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer
vision have data sets.  This module makes the most popular and standard datasets
(even the big awkward ones) easy to access from Python programs.
